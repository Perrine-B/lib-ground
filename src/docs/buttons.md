To begin, I want to create some buttons (how original !). I probably create several ones. So, into the components file (here it will exceptionnally be Tutorial file nut whatever), I gonna create a folder called Buttons to gather all my future creations. Moreover, at the same time I add to my directory tree a new section.

Then, I make a new folder that focuses on my new componant and will be entitled after it. It will include : 
- a js file
- a markdown file

OK, ready to start !
